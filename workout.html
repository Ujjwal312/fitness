              <p class="text">It is actually a sub-category of physical activity. Physical activity is any form of exercise or movement of the body that uses energy. Some of your daily life activities—doing active chores around the house, yard work, walking the dog—are examples.

             Cycling is a good way to control or reduce weight, as it raises your metabolic rate, builds muscle and burns body fat. If you’re trying to lose weight, cycling must be combined with a healthy eating plan.Cycling is a comfortable form of exercise and you can change the time and intensity – it can be built up slowly and varied to suit you.

                <span id="text1">Cardiovascular diseases include stroke, high blood pressure and heart attack. Regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases.

                Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse and reduces blood fat levels. Research also shows that people who cycle to work have two to three times less exposure to pollution than car commuters, so their lung function is improved.

            <p class="text">
                When you think of a runner’s body, you probably think of a certain body type: long, lean, and leggy. However, runners come in as many sizes and shapes as everyone else, and each body will respond in its own way to training.

                Even at the elite level, a sprinter’s body is going to look different from a marathoner’s body, and a sprinter’s training will look very different from that of a distance runner. <a href="#" onclick="f2()" id="r2">...read more</a>   

             <span id="text2" > Add the myriad fitness runners, bucket list marathoners, and people just trying to increase their endurance or burn a few calories, and you’ve got a wide range of silhouettes — all of which should be considered “runners’ bodies.”

                That said, building a running habit will make an impact on your body, often in unexpected ways. Below, we’ll look at the ways running can change your body — inside and out — when you begin to take it seriously.

            <p class="text">
                If you could do one thing to improve your health, strength training should be at the top of your list. It involves using one or more muscle groups to perform a specific task, such as lifting a weight or squatting.

                Due to the growing body of evidence supporting its many benefits, strength training has become a fundamental part of most exercise programs.  <a href="#" onclick="f3()" id="r3">...read more</a>
             <span id="text3" >Resistance training (also called strength training or weight training) is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build strength, anaerobic endurance and size of skeletal muscles.

                Resistance training is based on the principle that muscles of the body will work to overcome a resistance force when they are required to do so. When you do resistance training repeatedly and consistently, your muscles become stronger.    <a href="#" onclick="f6()" id="r6">...show less</a>         </span>

<div id="one" class="plans plan1">
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Aerobic fitness</h3>
<p>Aerobic activity, also known as cardio or endurance activity, is the core of most fitness training programs. Aerobic activity or exercise causes you to breathe faster and more deeply. The breathing boosts
     how much oxygen is in the blood.</p>
</div>
<div id="two" class="plans">
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Strength training</h3>
    <p>Strength training is another key part of a fitness training plan. Muscular fitness can help you increase bone strength and muscle fitness. And it can help you stay at a 
        healthy weight or lose weight. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="three" class="plans">
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Core exercises</h3>
        <p>The muscles in the stomach area, also called abdomen, lower back and pelvis are known as the core muscles. Core muscles help protect the back and connect
             upper and lower body movements.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="four"  class="plans">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Flexibility and stretching</h3>
            <p>Flexibility is an important piece of physical fitness. Aim to have stretching and flexibility activities in a fitness plan. Stretching exercises 
                can help increase flexibility.</p>

            <div id="five" class="plans">
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Maintain diet</h3>
                <p>What do you mean by diet?
                    Diet refers to the total amount of food consumed by individuals; whereas nutrition is the process of utilising food for growth,
                     metabolism and repair of tissues.</p>
